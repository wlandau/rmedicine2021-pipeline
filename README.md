# Target Markdown and stantargets for Bayesian model validation pipelines

The `targets` R package enhances the reproducibility, scale, and maintainability of data science projects in computationally intense fields such as machine learning, Bayesian Statistics, and statistical genomics. Recent breakthroughs in the targets ecosystem make it easy to create ambitious, domain-specific, reproducible data analysis pipelines. Two highlights include Target Markdown, an R Markdown interface to transparently communicate the entire process of pipeline construction and prototyping, and `stantargets`, a new rOpenSci package that generates specialized workflows for Stan models while reducing the required volume of user-side R code. The `index.Rmd` R Markdown report in this repository demonstrates both capabilities in a simulation-based workflow to validate a Bayesian longitudinal linear model common in clinical trial data analysis.
